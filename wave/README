WAVE - simulation of 2D-wave propagation in time, using parallel computation


REQUIRED SOFTWARE

On Ubuntu, you will need the follwing software packages to compile and run
the simulation:

* libhdf5-serial-dev
* libopenmpi-dev
* openmpi-bin
* openmpi-common
* make
* gcc

To create a simple animated gif with the the h52anim tool, you will also
need the following packages:

* hdf5-tools
* ImageMagick
* gnuplot


COMPILING

To compile the program:

1) set the environment variables 

  HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR

and

  HDF5_LIB_DIR

to the locations of the HDF5 include files and the libraries, respectively.

2) build the libthdf.a library, in the neigbouring directory, by running

  make

3) build the wave simulation program by running

  make

in this directory.

If you want to use OpenMP, add the flag "-fopenmp" to both the CFLAGS and
the LDFLAGS.


RUNNING wave

To run wave, use the small shell script; the shell script sets the options
needed for the simulation; however, feel free to play with the settings
and observe the effects of the time step on the stability of the solution,
the compute time, and explore the effects of using more cores.


VISUALISING THE SOLUTION

Run

  ./h52anim <result file> u

to create an animated gif with the solution. The animated gif can be viewed
in a webbrowser or file viewer.


FURTHER POST-PROCESSING

The results are written to an HDF5 file, this is a standard binary format for
storing simulation results. Third-party programs, such as Matlab, can
read and easily visualise the results.
